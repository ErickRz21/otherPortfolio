A dynamic web page built using pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that fetches movie data from the OMDb API. Users can search for movies by title and retrieve detailed information, including the plot, release year, genre, director, cast, and IMDb ratings. The page features a clean and responsive design, ensuring a smooth user experience across different devices. JavaScript is used to handle API requests and dynamically update the content without requiring a page reload.
